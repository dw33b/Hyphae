/*
 * 
 * Hyphae is a 2D cellular automaton laboratory and simulation environment.
 * Using a simple syntax, set up an arbitrarily long list of rules, each one holding an easy to interpret expression.
 * 
 * FIN(x):  ORDER:       TODO:
 *          4            1. Graphical user interface and viewport with multiple sets of controls.
 *          5                2. Within this environment, allow for user customization of window size, world size, and other things.
 *          6                    3. Custom tile appearance support (texture packs), each tile represented by a PNG image with the same name as the value of the tile
 * 
 *          7            1. Saving / Loading of rules, rulesets, world data, and any combination of all of these three.
 *          15               2. Export to a variety of other formats, including images, Tiled map data, raw text, masked text, etc...
 * 
 *          1            1. Syntax including parentheticals, accurate order of operations, and more complicated math concepts (metamath conditionals, nth dimensional addition, kernels)
 * 
 *          2            1. User input responsivity
 *          14               2. rules activated by user input
 *          8                2. user 'palette' and cell drawing capabilities
 * 
 *          11           1. Support for drawn regions identified by IDs
 *          12               2. create syntax for cells affecting drawn regions
 *          13               2. create syntax for specifying drawn region in syntax conditionals, EXAMPLE: if neighborhood center is contained by region 2, then...
 * 
 *          3            1. Layered system with spacial union logic, descending order
 *          16                2. During export, specify layers for export, including display layer
 * 
 *          9            1. Simulation settings including speed, starting conditions
 *          10               2. starting conditions as expression
